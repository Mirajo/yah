	The website redesign objective is to upgrade the website, build brand awareness, increase traffic, gain new customers and
	encourage customer loyalty. These objectives will be met by improving upon the websites presentation and functionality. 
	<br>
	Adding a blog section will create a dynamic content section that allows the website to have new content often. Providing
	links to the associated social media networks will help to foster open discussions about vegan foods and the challenges with
	making healthy eating choices that we all face.
